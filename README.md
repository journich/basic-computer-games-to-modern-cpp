# basic-computer-games-to-modern-cpp
Conversion of basic computer games book from David H Ahl to modern c++ (C++20).

See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games

There is a repository here that I contributed too.

A good portion of the Java ports were mine. Due to the maintainer allowing a bit of "Free for all" with coding standards, I decided to stop contributing.  Being old, I like to do things my own way haha

This time I am using my own repository and specifically converting games to modern C++, as a teaching aid for programmers wanting to look at modern c++ code examples.

The reality is that there is a lot of difference in writing modern C++ code vs old school c++.

I'm not expert with C++ (my expertise is Java), so expect the code to start off bad and get better the more commits I do. I see this as a win win for me to learn modern C++ and for hopefully budding students of C++ wanting to learn the language to get some value out of it.

The plan is to complete all games from the book above(convert from Basic to C++) and then tackle the second book.

I won't necessarily complete them in order from the book, but rather, intend to start with the simplier games to get them done, and more onto the more complex games like Star Trek and Hamurabbi as my modern C++ skills improve.
