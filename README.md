Conversion of basic computer games book from David H Ahl to modern c++ (C++20).

Many older programmers cut their teeth on the basic languages, and this book.  I was one of them.  Back in the day working on a Microbee Z80 computer with 16K of ram.  I learned a lot with typing in the games in this book and trying to get them working.  Not always successfully due to differences in dialects of basic, and my lack of skill as programmer at the time (most likely the latter). 

Coding-horror started a great project to convert these vintage basic games to a multitude of memory safe languages.

My understanding is that he has David Ahl's permission as well.

I loved the idea of helping a new generation of programmers by showing them the old basic code working in modern languages and decided to contribute to the Java ports.

A good portion of the Java ports were mine. Due to the maintainer allowing a bit of "Free for all" with coding standards, I decided to stop contributing.  Being old, I like to do things my own way haha

This time I am using my own repository and specifically converting games to modern C++, as a teaching aid for programmers wanting to look at modern c++ code examples.

The reality is that there is a lot of difference in writing modern C++ code vs old school c++.

I'm not expert with C++ (my expertise is Java), so expect the code to start off bad and get better the more commits I do. I see this as a win win for me to learn modern C++ and for hopefully budding students of C++ wanting to learn the language to get some value out of it.

The plan is to complete all games from the book above(convert from Basic to C++) and then tackle the second book.

I won't necessarily complete them in order from the book, but rather, intend to start with the simplier games to get them done, and more onto the more complex games like Star Trek and Hamurabbi as my modern C++ skills improve.

There is a great resource to play the old games online here.

I'll be using this as a resource to test out the games (in basic).  But I'll also use the basic interpreter here

When I contributed the Java ports originally I used this, and it mostly worked with the code, only requiring the odd change here and there to the original source code.

Speaking of the original source code, I won't duplicate it here.

But you can download the original code for each game here

https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games

Just go into the relevant game

e.g. 01_Acey Ducey

https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games/tree/main/01_Acey_Ducey

And at the bottom you will find the .bas file being the original source code.

You can also find all the original code in various languages there (including my Java stuff).

In addition the source code is available here.
